                            Created in France and then developed in the atelier of an old
                            Japanese soy sauce brewing company (est.1882), the Oiseau
                            Merveilleux products bring the best from both worlds. Which offers
                            a unique and timeless addition to food solutions. Hence, in 2022,
                            Oiseau Merveilleux has decided to make this delicacy readily
                            available to the world, by sharing the magic of its sauce.

                            Our extensive research led us to the revelation that there is no Asian sauce that is linked
                            to the words luxury and gourmet. Oiseau Merveilleux, as a brand, is a fusion of Japanese,
                            Indonesian and Chinese traditions, culture, ingredients and savoir-faire with a hint of the
                            exquisite gourmet food of France.
                            Our wonder sauces, which are brewed through traditional soybean fermentation, are unique
                            recipes that revamp the cooking experience for all types of cooks, ranging from amateurs to
                            professionals. We provide versatile sauces with refined Asian flavors offering an
                            unprecedented culinary experience through its luxury glass packaging and designs, which can
                            also be upcycled. <br> <br>

                            For our products we chose the best Miron Violet Bio Glass jars, which can be *upcycled and
                            re-used, they fit any fridge, and look good in any kitchen. We care about the environment
                            and our luxury jars can be easily transformed into decorative objects or re-used for many
                            other purposes.<br> <br>
                            ☞ Upcycling is the practice of adapting an existing product in some way to add value. The

                            One of the initial concerns a food company has when venturing out to provide food solutions
                            that are rich in taste is to ensure that the product remains healthy and nutrient-rich.
                            In an effort to do so, our primary concern was to avoid unhealthily additives and
                            preservatives so that the sauces could be as organic as possible. To keep our customers
                            healthy, artificial flavors and trans fats too were never an option. <br> <br>
                            Another concern we faced was to make sure our products could cater to the needs of the
                            diversity that exists in our consumers. Several versions have been developed to cater to
                            their individual needs, be it for vegans, vegetarians, or individuals with gluten
                            intolerance and celiac disease. Consequently, our consumers have authentic taste, free from
                            artificial components, colorants, and additives. <br> <br>
                            Our customers rely on us to provide them with the absolute best, and at Oiseau Merveilleux,
                            we believe that it is our duty and obligation to ensure that our customers are satisfied
                            with both our product and our commitment.
